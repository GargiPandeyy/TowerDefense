# Tower Defense Game

a tower defense game built with html, css, and javascript

I made this project because i was thinking of creating a game which involves some shooting so i built this project which involves shooting from a tower.

I struggled a lot in building the game loop and animations, drawing everything on the canvas, making enemies follow the path smoothly, and getting bullets to hit (including splash damage). Figuring out how towers pick targets, handle range and fire-rate timing, and upgrading was quite a lot of disturbing(i thought i should leave this project). Converting mouse clicks to the grid and preventing placement on the path took a lot of time(comments helped a lot). Managing money, health, waves, and UI updates together without bugs was hard, and tuning enemy stats so waves felt fair was a big learning. 

I made it with a lot of struggle(especially in javascript) but i learned a lot of concepts as well such as smooth game loop with requestAnimationFrame, canvas drawing, coords + collision math, and waypoint movement. Built OOP entities (enemies/towers/bullets), targeting + cooldown logic, grid snapping from mouse, and wave balancing.
